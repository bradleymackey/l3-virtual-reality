For tilt \& yaw correction, $\alpha _{tilt}=0.001$, $\alpha _{yaw}=0.0001$. Notice the clear improvements and reduction in axis drift as more levels of error correction are added to the raw dead-reckoning data. Error reduction can be most clearly seen at the end of the reading, where the drift is minimal with corrections. The erratic angle changes occurring at $t\approx 14$ and $t\approx 15$ is caused by gimbal lock induced by the rotation of the IMU and the fact we are displaying this data as Euler angles, which is a major limitation of the Euler angle representation.\relax }}{3}}

For tilt \& yaw correction, $\alpha _{tilt}=0.001$, $\alpha _{yaw}=0.001$. Notice the clear improvements and reduction in axis drift as more levels of error correction are added to the raw dead reckoning data. The clear area of error reduction is in the two axes that are supposed to have 0 angle (these vary as the time progresses) between the times $t\approx 3$ and $t\approx 17$. The erratic angle changes occurring at $t\approx 18$ and $t\approx 20$ is caused by gimbal lock induced by the rotation of the IMU and the fact we are displaying this data as Euler angles.\relax }}{2}}

The blue, green and red vectors correspond to the $z$, $y$ and $x$ vectors respectively. Vectors shown are the final positions of the IMU after all data points were played back. It is clear there is less drift as more levels of correction are included in the calculation of the true orientation Data was recorded for each of the correction methods and interactively displayed in 3D using \texttt  {matplotlib} for Python. Due to technological constraints, data was recorded at 40x slower than realtime, recorded and played back at realtime, then half speed. With all levels of correction, the micro-judders caused by twitchy movements of the IMU are not able to be corrected, so the judders are visible in all animations. The reduced drift is noticeable in both the tilt and tilt \& yaw corrected movements though---although the difference between these two is minor.\relax }}{3}}
